Create a weather forecast image with the following specifications:

**Visual Style & Layout:**
- Clean, modern weather app aesthetic with a blue gradient background (#4A90E2 to #87CEEB)
- Centered composition with clear visual hierarchy
- Professional but approachable design suitable for mobile/web display

**Required Elements:**
- Large, prominent temperature display (use bold, white text, minimum 48px equivalent)
- Weather condition icon/illustration that matches today's forecast exactly
- Subtle location indicator if space permits
- Maintain visual consistency with this commentary: "%s"

**Weather Condition Guidelines:**
- Sunny: Bright sun with rays, clear sky, warm yellow/orange tones
- Partly Cloudy: Mix of sun and fluffy white clouds
- Cloudy: Gray/white clouds covering most of sky
- Rainy: Rain drops, dark clouds, puddles or umbrellas
- Stormy: Lightning bolts, dark storm clouds, dramatic atmosphere
- Snowy: Snowflakes, white/light blue palette, winter elements
- Foggy: Misty/hazy overlay, reduced visibility effect

**Technical Requirements:**
- Focus ONLY on today's weather conditions from this forecast: %s
- Temperature should be the most prominent text element
- Use weather-appropriate color accents while maintaining blue background base
- Ensure text is highly readable with proper contrast
- Image should be optimized for web display (clear at both mobile and desktop sizes)
- Avoid cluttering - prioritize clarity and immediate visual understanding

**Tone Alignment:**
- The image should complement the snarky/witty commentary style
- Professional enough for a weather app, engaging enough to match personality
- Balance informative weather data with visual appeal
